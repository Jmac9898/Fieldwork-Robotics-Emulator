How do I start the program?
---------------------------

To start the application, you can either extract this ZIP folder or choose to run it through the ZIP folder. To start the application itself, click on the 'SoftwareDesign.exe' file in the Emulator folder. You may be greeted by a anti-virus protection window on your computer, please ignore this, it is common for custom made applications to trigger this.

How do I use the emulator?
--------------------------

Once launched, you will be greeted with a Setup window. Here you must do the following:

--------------------------
SETUP:

1. To configure an arm, click a robot arm. 

2. This will open another window with a drop-down menu to select a grade. Click 'Select Grade' and scroll to your desired grade or you may choose to disable the arm, preventing it from picking (for cases where an arm is faulty but the machine can still run). If done correctly, the arm in the Setup window will change colour and your chosen configuration will be confirmed in text beside the arm.

3. Repeat this for all the robot arms.

4. Press Configure to confirm all choices.
--------------------------


--------------------------
EMULATOR:

Once setup is complete, you will be greeted with the emulator window. Click 'Run' to begin the emulation. If you wish to perform an emergency stop, click the 'STOP' button. To continue the emulation after an emergency stop, click 'Run' again.

If you wish to go back and change the configuration of the arms and restart the process, click the 'Back' button and repeat the SETUP process.
